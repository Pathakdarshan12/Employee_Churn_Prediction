# Employee Churn Prediction Project

## Introduction ðŸ‘‹
Employee churn is a critical challenge for organizations across various industries. Accurate prediction of employee churn can provide valuable insights for HR departments and management teams, enabling them to implement proactive measures aimed at retention and talent management. This project leverages various machine learning and deep learning techniques to develop a predictive model for employee churn, assisting organizations in identifying at-risk employees and devising effective retention strategies.

## Problem Statement ðŸŽ³
As the global economy evolves, employee churn has become a significant issue for companies. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast employee attrition based on a variety of factors. By analyzing the employee data, we aim to uncover the underlying factors that contribute to churn and provide actionable insights for improving employee retention.

## Dataset ðŸ¤”
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains detailed employee information such as name, age, department, income, etc., along with data on employee churn. The dataset will be used to train and evaluate machine learning models to predict churn.

## Project Objectives ðŸ“Œ
This notebook aims to:
1. Perform dataset exploration using various types of data visualization.
2. Build a machine learning model that can predict employee attrition.
3. Export prediction results on test data into files.
